The story is set in Greenwich Village, a neighborhood in New York City, and revolves around two young artists,
Johnsy (short for Joanna) and Sue, who live together in a small apartment. The story begins with Johnsy falling
seriously ill with pneumonia as winter sets in. The doctor is pessimistic about her chances of recovery and warns
Sue that Johnsy has little hope unless she finds the will to live.
